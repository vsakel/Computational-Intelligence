## MNIST Dataset MLP Classifier
- Built a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier using the Keras framework to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- Optimized the model's performance by performing hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the number of neurons in first and second hidden layers, learning rate and regularization hyperparameter.

## Boston Housing Dataset Prediction with RBF Neural Network
- Developed a custom Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network using the Keras framework for predicting house prices based on the Boston Housing dataset.
- Enhanced the model's accuracy by tuning its hyperparameters with cross-validation, including  optimizing the number of neurons in the RBF layer and the second hidden layer, as well as adjusting the dropout probability..
